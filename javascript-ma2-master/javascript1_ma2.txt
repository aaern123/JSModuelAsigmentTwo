//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?

A function literal is simply an expression that defines an UN-NAMED function

2. What is the constructor?

Since JavaScript dont have any class statement, they use constructors too bring something similar functionality
Construct are like normal functins that used with NEW keyword.

3. What does the return statement do?

A return statement stops the execution of a function and returns value from that function

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();

The function will write out  “ Inside my function” because the return will stop the execution of the functio after the return sentence.


5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.

Scopes can be divided into local scope, block scope and a global scope
scopes tell us where our variables are and where they are available for us too use
if its a global scope, the variable is located globally and can be accesses too every object inside the JS file
if its a local scope the variable will only be available locally inside an object.
